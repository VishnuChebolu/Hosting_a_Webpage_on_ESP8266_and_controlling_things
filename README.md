# Hosting_a_Webpage_on_ESP8266_and_controlling_things
In this project, I've hosted a webpage on ESP8266 WiFi module and let the user control things using buttons present there

<p><b><i>Points To be remembered: </i></b></p> 

- We use HTTP (80)server for GET request
- We can create own wifi by using softAp function in WiFi module with desirable username and password
  `Note` -  There will be no internet connection available in this WiFi
